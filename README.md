# Week 3: Data Structures – Linked List Fundamentals

## 📅 Day 5 – Linked List Implementation & Operations  
**Date:** 02-Jan-2026

Focused on strengthening Linked List data structure fundamentals by implementing node-based list structures and traversal operations while following professional coding standards.

### What I practiced today:
- **Linked List Concepts:**
  - Understanding node structure
  - Creating and linking nodes
  - Traversing through linked lists
- **Linked List Operations:**
  - Insertion at beginning, end, and specific positions
  - Deletion of nodes
  - Searching elements in a linked list

### Best Programming Practices Followed:
- Designed small, focused, and reusable methods.
- Avoided hard-coded values wherever possible.
- Followed proper indentation and readability standards.
- Used meaningful variable and method names.

### Work Done:
- Completed linked list implementation and operations practice.
- Implemented multiple linked list programs.
- Tested, committed, and pushed all programs to GitHub.

📌 **Key Takeaway:**  
Gained a strong understanding of how linked lists work internally and how to implement dynamic, node-based data structures in Java using clean and modular code.
