# Week 2: Java Strings and oops concepts
## 📅 Day 4 – Object-Oriented Programming Fundamentals  
**Date:** 26-Dec-2025

Focused on strengthening Object-Oriented Programming fundamentals by understanding and implementing Java class and object concepts while following professional coding standards.

### What I practiced today:
- **Object-Oriented Programming Concepts:**
  - Understanding classes and objects
  - Creating and accessing object members
  - Using constructors
  - Method invocation through objects
- **Java Methods:**
  - Defining and calling methods
  - Passing parameters and returning values
  - Method overloading
- **Java Class Design:**
  - Designing clean and meaningful class structures
  - Using multiple objects for a single class

### Best Programming Practices Followed:
- Designed classes with clear responsibilities.
- Followed proper naming conventions for classes, methods, and variables.
- Encapsulated logic within methods instead of writing code directly in `main()`.
- Created reusable methods to reduce code duplication.

### Work Done:
- Implemented multiple Java programs demonstrating classes, objects, and methods.
- Tested programs using different object instances.
- Committed and pushed all OOPS-based programs to GitHub.

## 📅 Day 5 – Java Constructors, Instance vs Class Variables  
**Date:** 27-Dec-2025

Focused on strengthening Java Constructors and understanding the difference between instance and class variables by exploring object initialization, memory behavior of variables, and class design principles while following professional coding standards.

### What I practiced today:
- **Java Constructors:**
  - Purpose and usage of constructors
  - Default constructor
  - Parameterized constructor
  - Constructor overloading
  - Use of the `this` keyword
- **Instance vs Class Variables:**
  - Instance variables and their memory allocation
  - Class (static) variables and shared memory behavior
  - Difference between instance and static members
- **Object Initialization:**
  - Initializing objects using constructors
  - Accessing variables and methods using objects

### Best Programming Practices Followed:
- Used variables for all fixed values, user inputs, and results.
- Implemented logic using methods instead of writing everything inside `main()`.
- Followed proper naming conventions for variables and methods.
- Used meaningful program and class names.

### Work Done:
- Completed Java Constructors and Instance vs Class Variables programs.
- Inserted all programs into submission documents.
- Tested, committed, and pushed all programs to GitHub.

  - `static` variables and methods
  - `final` variables, methods, and classes
- **Object Handling:**
  - Understanding the `instanceof` operator
  - Checking object types at runtime

### Best Programming Practices Followed:
- Used variables for all fixed values, user inputs, and results.
- Implemented logic using methods instead of writing everything inside `main()`.
- Followed proper naming conventions for variables and methods.
- Used meaningful program and class names.

### Work Done:
- Completed programs demonstrating `this`, `static`, `final`, and `instanceof`.
- Inserted all programs into submission documents.
- Tested, committed, and pushed all programs to GitHub.
