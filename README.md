# Week 2: Java Strings and oops concepts
## 📅 Day 4 – Object-Oriented Programming Fundamentals  
**Date:** 26-Dec-2025

Focused on strengthening Object-Oriented Programming fundamentals by understanding and implementing Java class and object concepts while following professional coding standards.

### What I practiced today:
- **Object-Oriented Programming Concepts:**
  - Understanding classes and objects
  - Creating and accessing object members
  - Using constructors
  - Method invocation through objects
- **Java Methods:**
  - Defining and calling methods
  - Passing parameters and returning values
  - Method overloading
- **Java Class Design:**
  - Designing clean and meaningful class structures
  - Using multiple objects for a single class

### Best Programming Practices Followed:
- Designed classes with clear responsibilities.
- Followed proper naming conventions for classes, methods, and variables.
- Encapsulated logic within methods instead of writing code directly in `main()`.
- Created reusable methods to reduce code duplication.

### Work Done:
- Implemented multiple Java programs demonstrating classes, objects, and methods.
- Tested programs using different object instances.
- Committed and pushed all OOPS-based programs to GitHub.

📌 **Key Takeaway:**  
Developed a solid understanding of Java OOPS fundamentals by applying classes, objects, constructors, and methods to design clean, modular, and reusable programs.
