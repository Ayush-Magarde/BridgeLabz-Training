# Week 3: Data Structures – Linked List Fundamentals

## 📅 Day 5 – Linked List Implementation & Operations  
**Date:** 02-Jan-2026

Focused on strengthening Linked List data structure fundamentals by implementing node-based list structures and traversal operations while following professional coding standards.

### What I practiced today:
- **Linked List Concepts:**
  - Understanding node structure
  - Creating and linking nodes
  - Traversing through linked lists
- **Linked List Operations:**
  - Insertion at beginning, end, and specific positions
  - Deletion of nodes
  - Searching elements in a linked list

### Best Programming Practices Followed:
- Designed small, focused, and reusable methods.
- Avoided hard-coded values wherever possible.
- Followed proper indentation and readability standards.
- Used meaningful variable and method names.

### Work Done:
- Completed linked list implementation and operations practice.
- Implemented multiple linked list programs.
- Tested, committed, and pushed all programs to GitHub.

## 📅 Day 6 – Stack, Queue, HashMap & Hashing Functions  
**Date:** 03-Jan-2026

Focused on strengthening core Data Structure concepts including Stack, Queue, HashMap, and Hashing Functions by implementing fundamental operations and understanding hashing mechanisms while following professional coding standards.

### What I practiced today:
- **Stack Concepts:**
  - Stack operations (`push`, `pop`, `peek`)
  - Understanding LIFO principle
  - Handling overflow and underflow conditions
- **Queue Concepts:**
  - Queue operations (`enqueue`, `dequeue`)
  - Understanding FIFO principle
  - Implementing queue using arrays
- **HashMap & Hashing:**
  - Understanding key-value pair storage
  - Hashing functions and collision handling
  - Insertion, deletion, and searching operations

### Best Programming Practices Followed:
- Designed small, focused, and reusable methods.
- Used meaningful variable and method names.
- Followed proper indentation and readability standards.
- Structured logic clearly for maintainability.

### Work Done:
- Completed Stack, Queue, HashMap, and Hashing Functions practice.
- Inserted all programs into submission documents.
- Tested, committed, and pushed all programs to GitHub.
